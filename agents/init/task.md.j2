Initialize this repository for GBA.

## Current Directory Tree

```
{{ repo_tree }}
```

## Steps

1. Analyze the repository structure, identifying:
   - Programming languages and frameworks used
   - Build system and toolchain
   - Project layout conventions (monorepo, workspace, etc.)
   - Key modules and their responsibilities
   - Entry points and public APIs
   - Testing patterns

2. Create a single `.gba.md` file at the project root containing:
   - A one-paragraph project overview
   - Directory structure with brief descriptions of each key directory
   - Languages, frameworks, and build tools used
   - Key modules, types, traits, and interfaces
   - Conventions and patterns used in the codebase
   - Entry points and public APIs

3. Update `CLAUDE.md` at the repository root:
   - Add a "## Project Context" section if it does not already exist
   - Add a reference to `.gba.md` (e.g., "See `.gba.md` for a codebase overview.")

Note: The `.gba/` directory, `.trees/` directory, and `.gitignore` entry have already been created by the init workflow. Do not recreate them.

Focus on directories that contain source code and configuration. Skip generated output directories (e.g., `target/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`).
