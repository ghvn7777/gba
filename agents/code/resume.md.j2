Resume implementation from **Phase {{ phase_index }}/{{ total_phases }}: {{ phase.name }}**

A previous run was interrupted. The following phases have already been completed:

{% for cp in completed_phases %}- **Phase {{ cp.index }}**: {{ cp.name }} (commit: `{{ cp.commit }}`)
{% endfor %}

## Current Phase

**{{ phase.name }}**

{{ phase.description }}

## Tasks

{% for task in phase.tasks %}- {{ task }}
{% endfor %}

## Instructions

1. Review the work already committed in previous phases before starting.
2. Do NOT redo or modify completed phases. Build on top of them.
3. Implement the tasks for the current phase.
4. Ensure the code compiles and existing tests still pass.
5. Continue with remaining phases after this one is complete.
